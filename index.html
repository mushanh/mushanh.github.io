            <p class="project-intro">This is my very first project when I started to learn coding in 2017. The technology is just very basic HTML and CSS. I didn't know what I was doing, but seeing the text float and the image adjust made me very happy then as a true beginner. <a class="link" href="https://mushanh.github.io/IPNP-project1/" target="_blank">Take a look.</a></p>

                I learned JS and tried to do things (based on study materials) on and off for a long period of time but I am never really able to build my own things. I don't think I ever really learn learn JS. I've been listening to <a class="link" href="syntax.fm" target="_blank">syntax.fm</a> (a podcast) for a while and I recently found that one of the hosts Wes Bos made this <a class="link" href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge</a> free online. EXACTLY what I need! 
                Here's what I built!

            <p>It was originally a drum kit, but I changed it into a piano kit. The ti sound is off but that's the free sound I could find.</p>
